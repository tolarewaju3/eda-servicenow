# Event Driven Ansible Password Reset Demo

## The Problem

**40% of IT help desk time go towards password related tasks**, such as resetting employee's forgotten passwords. While employees wait, productivity stalls, costing money on both endsâ€”IT resolving the issue and employees stuck in limbo. 

**Enter Event-Driven Ansible.** It automates responses to events, like password reset tickets, saving time and money.

## The Architecture

Our archiecture will capture ServiceNow password reset tickets, reset the password on a RHEL host, and notify the user. The architecture has three main parts.

* **SerivceNow Developer Environment** - IT Service management for password reset tickets
* **Ansible EDA** - Event Driven Automation to respond to password reset tickets
* **RHEL Host** - Password reset target

## Setup ServiceNow Envrionment

We'll use ServiceNo to capture our password request tickets. Fortunately, ServiceNow gives out developer accounts with free instances.

If you already have a ServiceNow instance in your environment, feel free to skip this step.

**First, sign up for a developer account.** Navigate to [developer.servicenow.com](https://developer.servicenow.com) and select `Sign Up and Start Building`.

![ServiceNow home](img/servicenow_home.png)

Fill out all the relevant information and hit `Sign Up`. Once you're signed in, you should see a screen that looks like this.

![ServiceNow sign up](img/servicenow_signup.png)

**Request your ServiceNow instance**. In the top right corner, select `Request Instance`. Select the location that is nearest you and hit `Request`.

Next, we'll send events to Event Driven Ansible each time we open a ticket (or incident). For entierprise instances of ServiceNow, you can just add the Ansible EDA add-on from the store. But if you're using the developer instance, we'll create a business rule for this.

**Create a Business Rule to send our ticket to Ansible**. In your instance, go to the top left and select `All`. Type `Business Rule` into the search bar. Select the one under `System Definition`.

![ServiceNow select business rule](img/select_business_rule.png)

In the top right, select `New` and enter the following:

* Name: Send Incident to Ansible EDA
* Table: Incident [Incident]
* Advanced: Selected
* When to run: async
* Insert: Selected

![ServiceNow select business rule](img/business_rule.png)

Switch over to the advanced tab and paste in this code.

```
(function executeRule(current, previous /*null when async*/) {
    // Webhook URL
    var webhookUrl = 'https://aap-aap.apps.cluster-tw277-1.dynamic.redhatworkshops.io/eda-event-streams/api/eda/v1/external_event_stream/7c22ea0b-cec1-4594-8266-7e76d8b8536e/post/';

    var userName = gs.getUser().getName(); // Full name of the user
    var userID = gs.getUser().getID();    // User sys_id
    var userEmail = gs.getUser().getEmail(); // User email address

    // Fetch caller details from the 'caller_id' field
    var caller = current.caller_id.getRefRecord(); // Get the full caller record
    var callerName = caller.getValue('name') || 'Unknown'; // Caller's full name
    var callerEmail = caller.getValue('email') || 'Unknown'; // Caller's email
    var callerID = caller.getUniqueValue(); // Caller's sys_id

    // Payload to send
    var payload = {
        incident_number: current.number.toString(),
        short_description: current.short_description.toString(),
        priority: current.priority.toString(),
        status: current.state.toString(),
        updated_by: current.sys_updated_by.toString(), // User who updated the record
        user: {
            name: userName,
            id: userID,
            email: userEmail
        },
        caller: {
            name: callerName,
            id: callerID,
            email: callerEmail
        }
    };

    // Create the RESTMessageV2 object
    var restMessage = new sn_ws.RESTMessageV2();
    restMessage.setEndpoint(webhookUrl);
	restMessage.setRequestHeader('Authorization', 'Bearer emkAoV-uFd0AFu5PSMgcd-m0QdIu6uRP7l5F5rG2XxE');
    restMessage.setHttpMethod('POST');

    // Set request headers
    restMessage.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');

    // Set the request body
    restMessage.setRequestBody(JSON.stringify(payload));

    try {
        // Execute the request
        var response = restMessage.execute();
        var httpStatus = response.getStatusCode();
        var responseBody = response.getBody();

        gs.info('Webhook sent successfully. Status: ' + httpStatus + ', Response: ' + responseBody);
    } catch (ex) {
        gs.error('Error sending webhook: ' + ex.message);
    }
})(current, previous);
```

There's a lot going on here. You don't need to understand every bit, but here are the important steps.

1. Build a payload with variables from our incident (username, userID, incident number)
2. Create a REST message with the payload and our authorization headers
3. Send the REST message to the Ansible webhook url

Click Submit to create the rule.

## Setup Ansible Envrionment

You'll need an Ansible environment (2.5) up and running. This guide does not cover how to install Ansible, but you can find those details here.

We'll create two projects -- an execution project and a decision project. 

The execution project contains our playbook that resets the password, while our decision project contains rulebooks to capture ServiceNow events.

**Create a New Execution Project.** Sign in to your ansible instance and select `Automation Execution` --> `Projects` --> `Create project`

* Name: password-reset
* Organization: Default
* Execution Environment: Default execution environment
* Source control type: Git
* Source control URL: https://github.com/tolarewaju3/eda-servicenow.git

You should see the Last job status as Success.

**Create a New Decision Project.** Sign in to your ansible instance and select `Automation Decisions` --> `Projects` --> `Create project`

Use the following details.

* Name: password-reset
* Organization: Default
* Source control URL: https://github.com/tolarewaju3/eda-servicenow.git


**Create a New Decision Environment.** On the left panel, select Decision Environment under `Automation Decisions`.

[This should actually be the default decision environment]
